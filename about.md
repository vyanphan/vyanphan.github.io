I am an EECS Undergraduate at UC Berkeley. My main interests are computer security, machine learning, and parallelizing software. Currently, I am a software security intern in the Cryptographic Operations Group at Qualcomm. <br>

In my spare time, I like drawing, reading, and cooking. I am also very bad at skateboarding.
